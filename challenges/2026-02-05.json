      "pro_tip": "DEPTH OF FIELD: Real cameras create natural bokeh with smooth focus falloff. Notice how foreground books are sharp while the background softly blurs \u2014 AI often struggles to replicate this consistent optical depth, producing either everything in focus or artificially uniform blur."

      "pro_tip": "SCREEN LIGHT: Real screens cast uneven light that falls off naturally with distance and bounces differently off varied surfaces. AI often renders screen glow as a uniform wash of color."
