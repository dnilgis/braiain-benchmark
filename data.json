The first message was sent between UCLA and Stanford in 1969, marking the birth of networked computing. In the 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN, introducing the HTTP protocol and HTML markup language. The 1990s saw explosive commercial growth with browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer making the web accessible to millions. Today, over 5 billion people use the internet, which has fundamentally transformed communication, commerce, education, and entertainment. From social media to cloud computing, the internet continues to evolve as the backbone of modern digital civilization, connecting devices, data, and people across the globe in ways unimaginable to its early pioneers.",

Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the World Wide Web in 1989 revolutionized information sharing by introducing hypertext and URL addressing. The 1990s brought commercialization, with companies like AOL, Yahoo, and Amazon pioneering online services. The dot-com boom, despite its crash in 2000, laid infrastructure for today's digital economy. Modern internet encompasses cloud computing, streaming services, social networks, and IoT devices.

The network expanded throughout the 1970s, adopting TCP/IP protocols that became the foundation of modern internet architecture. Tim Berners-Lee's 1989 invention of the World Wide Web transformed the internet from a research tool into a global information system, introducing browsers, HTML, and hyperlinks. The 1990s commercialization brought search engines like Google, e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay, and eventually social media networks. Today's internet connects over 5 billion people, facilitating instant global communication, cloud computing, streaming entertainment, and digital commerce.
