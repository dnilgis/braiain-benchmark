            "full_response": "The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s when the United States Department of Defense initiated research on a robust, fault-tolerant network known as ARPANET. This network was designed to facilitate communication between computers and was first demonstrated in 1969 when different universities successfully connected and shared data. Over the following decades, ARPANET expanded, and in 1974, the term \"internet\" was coined to describe the interconnected network of various computer systems. The introduction of TCP/IP protocols in 1983 standardized communication over the network, leading to the development of the modern internet. By the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee, making information more accessible and igniting the commercialization and widespread use of the internet.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the internet experienced explosive growth, both in terms of user base and technological advancements. The proliferation of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, along with the rise of search engines like Google, transformed how people accessed information. Businesses began to realize the potential for online presence, leading to the dot-com boom, where internet startups flourished, although many eventually failed in the subsequent crash. As broadband technology improved, it enhanced connectivity and transformed the internet from a text-based to a multimedia-rich environment, paving the way for social media platforms, e-commerce, and online content streaming services that define today's digital landscape.\n\nLooking toward 2030",
