This early network connected computers at different research institutions, allowing them to communicate and share resources. The 1980s saw the development of the Internet Protocol (IP) and the creation of the Domain Name System (DNS), which enabled the internet to expand beyond its initial scope.  As the internet grew, it became more accessible to the general public. The 1990s saw the rise of internet service providers (ISPs) and web browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. This led to a rapid increase in internet usage, with more people going online to access information, communicate with others, and conduct business. The early 2000s saw the emergence of social media platforms, online shopping, and streaming services, further transforming the way people interacted with the internet.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new forms of interaction and data exchange. As a result, the internet will continue to play an increasingly important role in shaping the world and its many complexities, and it will likely be a fundamental part of human life.",
