This early network connected computers at different research institutions, enabling communication and data sharing. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, allowing different networks to communicate with each other.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionizing the internet with hypertext links and web browsers. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the development of dial-up internet and internet service providers (ISPs). As broadband internet became widely available, online activities like e-commerce, social media, and streaming emerged.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices worldwide, and artificial intelligence (AI) enhancing online experiences.
