This initial network connected computers at different research institutions, enabling communication and data sharing. The 1980s saw the introduction of the Internet Protocol (IP), which allowed different networks to communicate with each other, forming the modern internet.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionizing the internet with user-friendly web pages and hyperlinks. The 1990s witnessed widespread adoption of the internet, with the emergence of internet service providers (ISPs) and web browsers like Netscape Navigator. As technology advanced, high-speed internet and mobile devices became ubiquitous, transforming the way people communicate, access information, and conduct daily activities.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more pervasive, with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and artificial intelligence (AI) integration, leading to increased automation and personalized experiences, and the internet will continue to shape the world, driving innovation and growth, and forever changing the way humans live and interact with each other.",
