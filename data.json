This network connected computers at various research institutions, allowing them to communicate and share data. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, enabling different networks to interconnect and form a single, global network.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionizing the internet by making it accessible to the general public through web browsers and hyperlinks. The 1990s saw widespread adoption of the internet, with the number of users growing exponentially. This period also saw the emergence of online services such as email, e-commerce, and social media, transforming the way people communicate, shop, and interact.  As we approach 2030, the internet is expected to continue its rapid evolution, with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) playing increasingly prominent roles. By 2030, it is predicted that the internet will be even more ubiquitous, with billions of devices connected and AI-powered services becoming the norm, fundamentally changing the way we live, work, and interact with each other.",
