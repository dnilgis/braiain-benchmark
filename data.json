This early network was the first to use packet switching, a method of transmitting data in small packets, which allowed for efficient and reliable communication. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, enabling different networks to communicate with each other and forming the modern internet.  The widespread adoption of the internet began in the 1990s with the development of the World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The web made it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. This led to a rapid expansion of the internet, with the number of users growing from millions to billions in just a few decades. The internet also enabled the development of new technologies, such as email, e-commerce, and social media, which have transformed the way people communicate, work, and live.  Today, the internet is an essential part of modern life, with billions of people around the world relying on it for information, communication, and entertainment.
