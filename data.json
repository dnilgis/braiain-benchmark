This early network connected computers at different research institutions, allowing them to communicate and share resources. The 1980s saw the development of the Internet Protocol (IP), which enabled different networks to interconnect and form a single, global network.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easier for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The 1990s saw the widespread adoption of the internet by the general public, with the number of users growing rapidly. This growth was driven by the development of user-friendly web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, and the increasing availability of internet service providers (ISPs).  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more ubiquitous and integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications and services. The use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other emerging technologies will continue to shape the internet and its applications, leading to new opportunities and challenges. The internet will continue to evolve and play an increasingly important role in shaping society and economy, transforming the way we live and work, and it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this technology.",
