This early network was the first to use packet switching, a method of transmitting data in small packets, which allowed for efficient and reliable communication. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, enabling different networks to communicate with each other and forming the modern internet.  The widespread adoption of the internet began in the 1990s with the development of the World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The web made it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. This led to a rapid expansion of the internet, with the number of users growing exponentially. The internet became an essential tool for communication, commerce, and information sharing, transforming the way people lived, worked, and interacted with each other.  Today, the internet is a global network of billions of interconnected devices, enabling instant communication and access to vast amounts of information. As technology continues to advance, the internet is expected to become even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) playing increasingly important roles. By 2030, the internet is likely to be even more ubiquitous and powerful, enabling seamless global communication and transforming the way people live and work.",
