The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easier for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online and CompuServe. As broadband internet became more prevalent, online activities like streaming and social media became possible.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications like smart homes and cities, and advancements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality will continue to transform the online experience, making it more immersive and interactive, and changing the way we live and work forever.",
