This early network connected computers at different research institutions, enabling communication and data sharing. The 1980s saw the development of the Internet Protocol (IP) and the creation of the Domain Name System (DNS), making it easier for users to access and navigate the network.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was introduced in the 1990s, revolutionizing the internet with user-friendly web browsers and hyperlinks. This led to widespread adoption and the internet's transformation into a global network. The early 2000s saw the rise of social media, online shopping, and streaming services, further expanding the internet's reach and impact.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) playing major roles. As technology continues to advance, the internet will likely become even faster, more secure, and more accessible, leading to new innovations and opportunities, and the internet will continue to shape the world as we know it today.",
