This network connected computers at various research institutions, allowing them to communicate and share data. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, enabling different networks to interconnect and form a single, global network.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionizing the internet by making it accessible to the general public through web browsers and hyperlinks. The 1990s saw widespread adoption of the internet, with the development of online services like email, e-commerce, and social media. This period also saw the emergence of internet service providers (ISPs) and the widespread use of dial-up connections.  As we approach 2030, the internet is expected to continue evolving with the integration of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The increasing adoption of 5G networks and edge computing will further enhance internet speeds and reduce latency. By 2030, the internet will be an even more integral part of daily life, with the potential to transform global connectivity and enable new forms of remote collaboration and innovation.",
