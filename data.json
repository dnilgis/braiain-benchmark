The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online (AOL) and CompuServe.  By 2030, the internet will be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications like smart homes and cities, and the internet will continue to revolutionize the way we live and work, with artificial intelligence and machine learning playing a major role in shaping its future, and it will be more secure and accessible to everyone.",
