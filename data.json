This network connected computers at different research institutions, allowing them to communicate.

The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easier for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online (AOL) and CompuServe. As broadband internet became more widely available, online activities like streaming, social media, and e-commerce became increasingly popular.  By 2030, the internet is likely to be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications like smart homes and cities, and autonomous vehicles will be common, transforming transportation and logistics, and virtual reality will become indistinguishable from reality.",
